Assuming that the website is a simple blog with the following features:
- Home page displaying latest blog posts
- Blog post page displaying the full blog post
- About page with information about the author
- Contact page with a form to send an email to the author

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This will be the entry point of the application and will handle routing and rendering of templates.
2. `models.py`: This will define the data models for the blog posts and contact form submissions.
3. `forms.py`: This will define the form used for the contact page.
4. `views.py`: This will define the functions that handle requests and return responses.
5. `templates/`: This directory will contain the HTML templates for the different pages of the website.
6. `static/`: This directory will contain static files such as CSS and images.

Here is the code for each file:

`app.py`
