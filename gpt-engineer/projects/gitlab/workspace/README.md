For the Flask project, we will use Python as the programming language and create the project using a virtual environment. We will not include any specific Flask extensions or libraries for the hello world project.

Core classes, functions, and methods:
- `app.py`: This file will contain the Flask application and routes.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the required dependencies for the project.
- `Dockerfile`: This file will contain the instructions to build a Docker image of the project.
- `gitlab-ci.yml`: This file will contain the instructions for the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

Here is the code for each file:

`app.py`
