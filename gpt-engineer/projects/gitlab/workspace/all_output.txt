For the Flask project, we will use Python as the programming language and create the project using a virtual environment. We will not include any specific Flask extensions or libraries for the hello world project.

Core classes, functions, and methods:
- `app.py`: This file will contain the Flask application and routes.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the required dependencies for the project.
- `Dockerfile`: This file will contain the instructions to build a Docker image of the project.
- `gitlab-ci.yml`: This file will contain the instructions for the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

Here is the code for each file:

`app.py`
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

`requirements.txt`
```
flask
```

`Dockerfile`
```docker
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

`gitlab-ci.yml`
```yaml
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay
  IMAGE_NAME: my-hello-world

before_script:
  - docker info
  - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .
    - docker tag $IMAGE_NAME $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$IMAGE_NAME
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$IMAGE_NAME

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$IMAGE_NAME python -m pytest

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..."
```

In the `gitlab-ci.yml` file, we have defined a pipeline with three stages: `build`, `test`, and `deploy`. In the `build` stage, we build a Docker image of the project and push it to the GitLab container registry. In the `test` stage, we run the tests using the built Docker image. In the `deploy` stage, we can add instructions to deploy the project to a production environment.
